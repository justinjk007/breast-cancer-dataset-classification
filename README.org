* Breast-Cancer-Dataset-Classification
Part 2 of Mini project 4, machine learning course Winter 2020

* About the data set
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate
(FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell
nuclei present in the image.

569 instances, 357 benign and 212 malignant

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32) (Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus):
   a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
   b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
   c) perimeter
   d) area
   e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
   f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
   g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
   h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
   i) symmetry
   j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
